      "description": "THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE; THIS IS MY JOURNEY. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR MONEY.\nWatch at 1.25x speed for a better viewing pleasure!\n\nMoney doesn't sit on the table long. When big investors see what Steem is really worth, being two weeks late could be the difference in life-changing opportunity. \n\nThe ability for Steem to be the Proof of Brain for the internet and form as a backbone for incentives communities whether it be bloggers, vloggers or Steem Monsters. \n\nWe will see projects built on top of Steem (@steemMonsters) that make it easy for people to buy in with fiat. This should be no different for every UI, be it for blogging or videos. An easy fiat on-ramp to Steem is, and we will see that ramp up in the future. People look at exchanges as the end all be all. \n\n99% of people will never, ever use an exchange. I repeat, 99% of people will never, ever use an exchange. How many people buy apple phones as compared to Apple stock. \n\nWhen someone wants to cash in and out of Steem, the projects that make that the easiest will be the ones that separate themselves from the pack. People wish to have one-click buy Steem in their account and one-click cashout into their legacy fiat wallets (banks, PayPal). \n\nWe are here, the foundation, the necessity in the age of Google and Facebook, we are the saving grace. \n\nWould be a conspiracy if big players weren't moving the market down.\nCrypto is so speculative and sentiment driven. - sheep\nopen source crypto is revolutionary since the internet.\n\nConfidence. \nDon't let outside influences dictate your beliefs.\nSteem was good at 8$ but sucks at .50cents is Fugazi\n\n20mil in a bull market is 5 mil in a bear\nThe ability to buy blood.\nYou see why \"buy low sell high\" is a meme.\nKnowledge is power = Confidence to buy blood.\n\n\"When millionaires inside trade, price pumps before the run, when billionaires inside trade the price dumps before the run.\"\n\nBig time traders are feeling weary, possible sign the selling could end. \n\nSteem is your voice, hold it dear.\nNothing great comes without first a bit of uncertainty.\n\nRemember, there is not enough Steem for every user of Reddit to have 1 Steem; if a few Steem are needed to have accounts even function, there isn't much to go around.\n\n\nSteem Witness Spotlight: @therealwolf\n\nRealWolf's Reasons:\n1.) Closing the gap between users and investors and \n2.) Bringing value to developers of Steem and the whole eco-system.\n\nMy Personal Reasons:\n3. RealWolf- humble, started out with nothing but knew that to have a positive impact he had to build himself up first. \"I can't give, what I don't have\" - wolf outlook\n4. Made himself easy to approach and seems always to be around.\nMy, go to with any question, @therealwolf @themarkymark & @acidyo \n5. Introvertish, however self-aware. He once posted admittingly saying he felt uncomfortable speaking out in someones else's thread but thought he should reply. Self-awareness with the ability to self-criticize and overcome being uncomfortable is the recipe to grow limitlessly.\n\nThe Final Reasons:\n6. Entrepreneur - Created @smartsteem -which introduced a whitelist model to the community. Recently added smart monsters (a cool way to buy/sell @steemmonsters cards) - adding smart monsters just shows the hustle of therealwolf and are the signs of someone who is successful. \n7. Dev at @utopian-io - trained himself to write Javascript, NodeJS and VueJS in 3 months - because \"I had ideas in my mind that I wanted to realize - but for this, I needed the Skills.\" - This shows determination. Active contributor on GitHub and was instrumental in resolving the post-hf situation with his client tools/assistance.\n8. sees himself as a developer of business ideas. \"I like to tinker around here and there and be creative and disruptive.\" - I'm a serial, and this mindset resonates with me. \n9. Runs a top-notch witness server and is always actively looking to improve it. check here https://therealwolf.me/\n10. He is 110% committed to Steem and proves it with significant skin in the game. \n\nMore on @therealwolf - \nhttps://steemit.com/witness/@therealwolf/making-steem-greater-therealwolf-is-now-a-witness\nhttps://steemit.com/steem/@therealwolf/witness-application-therealwolf-updated\nhttps://steemit.com/dlive/@therealwolf/907d9d74-9b3c-11e8-9e1e-0242ac110003\nVote for @therealwolf - \nhttps://steemit.com/~witnesses\n\nI'm going to kill it here. \n\nCheers, peace.
